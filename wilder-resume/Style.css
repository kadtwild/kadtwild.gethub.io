<h1> Tra Wilder <h1>
<main>
<H2> Bachelors of Communications in Production</h2>
<p1> My name is Tra Wilder and i am 21 years old. I'm a senior at the University of Tennessee at Martin. I work for WLJT Production, ESPN+, and University Relations as a photographer. At work, I deal with softwares such as Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, and Word.
I grew up in a small town and I grew up as the middle child, between my older sister and younger sister. I graduated from Dyersburg State and then I transfered to UTM. While here I have learded to write scripts, produce commercials, and interact behind the scenes 
and while on set. I have had all of these jobs for about a year now and I enjoy them. I like being able to work with others who have the same vision, understanding, and drive that I have. Once i got into college I started to gain an interest in photography 
and that has given me oppertunities like working with Nathan Morgan, University Photographer.</p>
<p2> My goals in life are to get my career going, settle down with my woman, and provide for my family. I would like to trevel the world with family and see the world and experience new things with them and my co-workers by putting our minds together and accomplish 
greatness.
